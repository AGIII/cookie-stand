  <h1>History of Pat's Salmon Cookies</h1>
  <p>
  Normally, both your ass would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

  Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped
  to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with
  a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that
  shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy
  store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping
  for an infant named Jeb.

  You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.
